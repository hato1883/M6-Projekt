## Contributing
### Creating a branch
To contribute to the projekt, you will need to create a **new branch**
The branch will follow the folowing naming scheme:  
`type-issueNum-shortDescription`  
For example if you are going to implemnt the requested feature from issue [#1](https://github.com/hato1883/M6-Projekt/issues/1) you would then create the branch:  
`feature-1-implement-chess-piece-enum`  
there ar multiple diffrent types that can be used, but here is a list of the most common:
- `bug` lable uses the type `bug`
- `documentation` label uses the type `doc`
- `needed` label uses the type `mvp` as in Minimum Viable Product
- `enhancement` label uses the type `feature`

### Commiting
Remember to use descriptive names for you commits whilst implementing. We want to avoid using commits that just say `fixed` or `done`.
Instead use sometinh more like `fixed issue with ...` or `Implemented feature ...` if the commits are on a small task.
If you are working on a lareger task remeber to commit during your way and use short descriptions on what the commit did.

### Pull request
When the issue has been solved in your local branch create a **PR** (_PR_ is short for pull request) to squash merge your branch into main.
This will (if tests pass) allow you to change the main-branch of repo so other contributers can pull your new changes.
Squash simply means that all your commits will be implemnted as 1 commit in the main branch with the name of your _PR_ to simplify the history tree.
(All commits can still be viewd in the branch history if needed)
